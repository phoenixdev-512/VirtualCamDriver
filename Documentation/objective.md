# 🎭 VirtualCam Hello – Make Any Webcam Work with Windows Hello

> 🚨 Turn an ordinary webcam into a **Windows Hello-compatible biometric camera** by impersonating certified hardware using a custom driver + Media Foundation hooks.

---

## 📌 Project Objective

**To develop a custom Windows driver that allows a regular RGB webcam to be detected and used as a compatible facial recognition camera by Windows Hello.**

This involves impersonating the capabilities of specialized biometric cameras (e.g., Intel RealSense), simulating additional streams (like IR), and exposing the expected interfaces and descriptors that Windows Hello requires for facial authentication.

---

## 🔧 Technical Goals

### 1. 🎭 Impersonate a Windows Hello-Compatible Camera
- Emulate hardware-level descriptors and interfaces of Hello-certified devices.
- Spoof known **Hardware IDs** (e.g., RealSense or Surface camera).
- Register the driver under the **Biometric** or **Imaging** device class.

### 2. 📦 Create a Custom Driver Package
- Modify and extend an existing driver or write a new one using **UMDF/KMDF**.
- Bundle `.inf`, `.dll`, `.cat`, and registration scripts.
- Use `pnputil` or `devcon` for manual installation/testing.

### 3. 🧬 Expose Required Stream Types (RGB, IR, Depth)
- Simulate **multi-stream output**:
  - RGB → from actual webcam
  - IR → grayscale/contrast-processed duplicate
  - Depth → optional (can be stubbed if not required)
- Present as multi-pin video capture device if needed.

### 4. 🛠️ Modify INF File for Compatibility
- Use proper class GUIDs and compatible interface registration.
- Add required biometric declarations for Hello support.
- Hook into existing Media Foundation Transforms (MFTs) or register your own.

### 5. 🎞️ Hook/Replace Media Foundation Transform (MFT)
- Reverse or wrap DLLs like `RsDMFT_Assets.dll`.
- Implement `IMFTransform` to manipulate or forward webcam stream.
- Ensure proper handling of sample buffers, timestamps, attributes.

### 6. ✅ Make Windows Hello Recognize the Device
- Show up in:
  - `Device Manager > Imaging or Biometric Devices`
  - `Settings > Accounts > Sign-in Options > Windows Hello Face`
- Allow registration of a face via **Windows Hello Setup Wizard**.

### 7. 🧪 Validate and Test Across Machines
- Test with various USB webcams.
- Check compatibility with:
  - Media Foundation pipeline
  - Windows Hello authentication service
- Log attempts, failures, and fallback behavior.
